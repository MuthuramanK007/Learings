Reflection:

What is that ? 
	It is a Java API, that help developers to checkout both exposed and hidden
features of a class regardless of their access privileges.

	Very useful for testing the behaviours of the objects by changing the state
of the objects.

What I've explored?
	Created one basic Class with mostly getters , and one private method.
	There is no setters for this class and all the instance variables are private.
	
	I've created one object of that type, and tested some of the methods available in 
java Reflection API.
	Should use reflection sparingly, when really needed.

	--> Meanwhile, also implemented the concept of Serialization, to reinforce my learning on that topic,
		 also to test the methods in Reflection API.
	--> tried to implement some coding principles, I've learned.
